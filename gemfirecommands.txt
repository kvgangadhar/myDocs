we should always concentrate on locator

gfsh overview
-------------
GemFire shell
set path=%path%;D:\GemFire\Pivotal_GemFire_827_b18_Windows\bin;

>gfsh

gfsh> help   -----all commands

>help start -------help on specific command

To start the locator
>start locator --name=locator

>list members --------shows members in cluster

>help start server
>help start locator
>start server --name=server1

once again execute command "list members" you will find it 2 members now



Regions are nothing but maps - which stores key and value
>help create region

>create region --name=people --type=REPLICATE   (both attributes are compulsory)

>list regions

GemFire supports object query lang(OQL)
>query --query="select * from /people"
Result :true
startCount : 0
endCount : 20
Rows : 0

>put --key=1 --value="Sanjay Degaonkar" --region=people

>describe region --name="people"

one thing watch under this command
Hosting Members : Server1
no need to bother about server

>start server --name=server2
you will get error message
diff port is required

>start server --name=server2 --server-port=0   (0 indicates Gemfire dynamically selects port number)

>list members
 locator
 server1
 server2


>describe region --name=people

...
Hosting Members : server2
                  server1

>stop server --name=server1

>list members
 locator
 server2

>query --query="select * from /people"
still works

>start server --name=server1


gfsh>exit
$>

exit is just disconnecting, not shutting down servers

>gfsh

>connect ----------------to connect

>shutdown --include-locators
by default it shuts down only servers.
don't type entire thing, use "tab" after two chars
